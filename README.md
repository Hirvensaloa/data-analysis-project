# Data analysis program

Note: This program is being developed in a private repository and is here for a reference.
Server doesnt start because there are no enviroment variables, for security reasons, and
therefore it cannot connect to database. 

Program is going to offer tools for analysing data and creating questionnaires for a physical device which can then collect data from clients. 

Program consists of frontend and backend. 

You can run frontend and backend from their folders with command ``npm start``. When running frontend or backend for the first time you need to 
run command ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
